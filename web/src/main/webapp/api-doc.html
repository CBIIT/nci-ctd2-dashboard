    <h2>Dashboard API Documention</h2>
    <p>We have designed and implemented the Dashboard API as an alternative route to access the content of the CTD²
        Dashboard. The Dashboard data has a hierarchical structure with submission centers - members of the CTD² network
        -
        at the top. At the next levels, each center provides multiple submissions to the Dashboard and each submission
        consists of one or more observations. Finally, at the bottom, each observation ties together various biological
        entities (subjects) and associated evidence fields. The Dashboard API allows clients to access data at any level
        of
        the hierarchy. The full specification is available in Dashboard’s GitHub repository
        (<a href="https://github.com/CBIIT/nci-ctd2-dashboard/blob/master/web/src/test/CTD2-Dashboard_API.yml"
            target=_blank>https://github.com/CBIIT/nci-ctd2-dashboard/blob/master/web/src/test/CTD2-Dashboard_API.yml</a>)
        and can be easily browsed by pasting it to a swagger editor at <a href="https://editor.swagger.io/"
            target=_blank>https://editor.swagger.io/</a></p>
    <h3>Dashboard content hierarchy</h3>
    <h4>Centers</h4>
    <p>Centers are the research teams that participate the CTD² Networks. They are the entities who submit the data,
        thus
        each template belongs to one specific center.</p>
    <h4>Submissions</h4>
    <p>A submission is a collection of related observations from a participating CTD² Network center, sharing the same
        structure and format, and representing findings from one or more experimental or/and computational
        investigations.
        Each submission can comprise multiple observations described using a submission-specific spreadsheet template,
        with
        each row corresponding to one observation and columns representing the data elements necessary for fully
        documenting
        an observation.</p>
    <h4>Observations</h4>
    <p>Observations are the main unit of knowledge in the Dashboard. They are statements describing subjects (e.g.,
        genes,
        cell lines, compounds) and the roles they play (e.g., target, background, candidate drug) in the context of a
        high
        level investigational finding, along with links to the computational or/and experimental evidence that support
        this
        finding. The following is an example of an observation.</p>
    <h4>Subjects and evidence</h4>
    <p>Subjects are the primary biological entities involved in the experimental or/and computational finding described
        by
        an observation. As the template example above shows, subjects within a submission are defined by their class and
        role. The subject class specifies the type of biological entity and can assume any among a predefined set of
        choices, namely: gene, shRNA, protein, cell sample, animal model, tissue sample, compound. Subjects can also
        have an
        associated role which further specifies their semantics in the context of an observation. E.g., in an
        observation
        from a compound screening experiment, a gene may be assigned the role of a “target” if it is the target of a
        screened compound; or the role of “biomarker” if it is a determinant of the cell line used for the screen.
        Finally,
        within an observation subjects assume values, typically from controlled vocabularies depending on their class.
    </p>
    <p>Observations can also be associated with evidence fields which can be used to capture supporting quantitative and
        qualitative data that are important in interpreting a finding (e.g., details of the experimental or
        computational
        protocol used) . As is the case with subjects, at the level of the submission each evidence items is defined by
        a
        value type and an evidence type (see example template above). The class assumes values from a fixed set of
        options
        (URL, label, data numeric, and file). And similarly to subjects, at the level of the observation, evidence
        assumes a
        value, albeit less constrained, i.e., evidence values don’t usually come from controlled vocabularies
        (literature,
        measured, link, reference, background, observed, computed, written, resources, species).</p>

    <h4>Dashboard API calls</h4>
    <p>There are six endpoints for the CTD² Dashboard API: (1) centers, (2) submission, (3) browse, (4) search, (5)
        observation, and
        (6) observations.</p>
