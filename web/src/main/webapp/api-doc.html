    <h2>Dashboard API Documention</h2>
    <p>We have designed and implemented the Dashboard API as an alternative route to access the content of the CTD²
        Dashboard. The Dashboard data has a hierarchical structure with submission centers - members of the CTD² network
        -
        at the top. At the next levels, each center provides multiple submissions to the Dashboard and each submission
        consists of one or more observations. Finally, at the bottom, each observation ties together various biological
        entities (subjects) and associated evidence fields. The Dashboard API allows clients to access data at any level
        of
        the hierarchy. The full specification is available in Dashboard’s GitHub repository
        (<a href="https://github.com/CBIIT/nci-ctd2-dashboard/blob/master/web/src/test/CTD2-Dashboard_API.yml"
            target=_blank>https://github.com/CBIIT/nci-ctd2-dashboard/blob/master/web/src/test/CTD2-Dashboard_API.yml</a>)
        and can be easily browsed by pasting it to a swagger editor at <a href="https://editor.swagger.io/"
            target=_blank>https://editor.swagger.io/</a></p>
